\chapter{Data and Research Design}
\label{data}

\paragraph*{}To measure the welfare effects of individualizing life-cycles compared to default life-cycles we will construct the stock, housing and labor income series from the past data, define the expected rates of return, volatilities and correlations from conventions and simulate a 30-year investment timespan of every type of investor until the retirement. We will then calculate certainty equivalent consumption levels and compare them. 

\section{Asset series}

\subsection{Stocks}
To measure the stock series we used BIST 30 index which measures the aggregate performance of 30 best companies in Turkey. The monthly data is taken from Borsa Istanbul.

\subsection{Housing}
To measure the house prices we used Reidin data on Istanbul house prices. AEINDEXF

\subsection{Labor income}
We used TUIK's Household Budget Survey Data and regression results of Aktug, Kuzubas, Torul (2017).



\section{Parameters}
