  \paragraph*{}First of all, I want to express my deepest gratitude to my mother \textit{Zulkhumor Khodzhimatova}, my father \textit{Sadykzhan Khodzhimatov} and my sisters \textit{Saodatkhon} and \textit{Salomatkhon} for giving me an opportunity to receive such a wonderful education, for supporting and encouraging me, for persuading me not to quit economics and always being there for me. I would never be here without you.
  \paragraph*{}I want to thank my high school math trainer, \textit{Ochilbek Rakhmanov}, for igniting my interest in theoretical mathematics and teaching me to learn independently. I also want to thank my first economics professor, \textit{Dr. Mehtap Işık}, for guiding me throughout my undergraduate journey towards economics.
  \paragraph*{}Finally, I want to thank my thesis supervisor \textit{Dr. Tolga Umut Kuzubaş}, whose courses were the most challenging and rewarding in my entire academic life, and \textit{Dr. Burak Saltoğlu}, whose openness to innovative approaches in economics still fascinates me. I am very grateful for their invaluable contribution to this thesis: they recommended me the research area, they shared with me their priceless expertise, they gave me a freedom in pursuing this research.
