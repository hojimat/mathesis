\chapter{Logarithms as percentage change}
\label{appb}

The first order Taylor series approximation of $\log(x)$ around $1$ gives $\log(x) \approx x - 1$. Thus, for any $x_t$, $x_{t+1}$ such that $\frac{x_{t+1}}{x_t}$ is close to $1$, we have:

\begin{center}
	$\log(x_{t+1}) - \log(x_t) = \log(\frac{x_{t+1}}{x_t}) \approx \frac{x_{t+1}}{x_t} - 1$,
\end{center}

which is a percentage change in $x_t$ between time periods $t$ and $t+1$.
